netapp-storage/section_data-ontap.xml:        Data ONTAP 8.x provides two operating modes, clustered Data ONTAP and 7-Mode. Clustered Data ONTAP operation enhances NetApp’s storage efficiency value by introducing massive scalability and nondisruptive operations. With clustered Data ONTAP 8, two or more controllers (or nodes) operate as one shared resource pool or storage cluster. The storage cluster can be expanded, contracted, and subdivided nondisruptively into one or more secure partitions, or <trademark class="registered">NetApp</trademark> Storage Virtual Machine (SVM). A SVM is a logical storage container that includes allocated storage resources from within the cluster as well as security parameters, such as rights and permissions. Logical interfaces allow clients to access data within a SVM from anywhere in the cluster. To the application, a SVM presents a securely partitioned storage pool that can be dynamically deployed and redeployed according to changing business requirements.
