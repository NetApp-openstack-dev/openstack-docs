Description of SolidFire Systems
================================

NetApp® SolidFire® is a scale-out, all-flash storage platform designed for
large-scale infrastructure. SolidFire is unique in its ability to manage
storage performance independent of capabilities, and guarantee performance,
not just to one application, but to thousands of applications within a
single storage platform. These capabilities, combined with a granular
scale-out architecture and the ability to automate every aspect of the
SolidFire storage platform, empower customers to streamline operations and
respond to changing business and application demands faster and more
predictably than ever before.

The agility, efficiency, and scalability benefits demonstrated from cloud
computing infrastructure have raised the bar on expectations for IT service
delivery. The pressure is on IT to:

- Rapidly deploy applications and service
- Provide more agile and scalable infrastructure
- Increase application performance and predictability
- Enable automation and end-user self service
- Raise operational efficiency and reduce cost

SolidFire is architected from the ground up to be the storage foundation of next
generation data centers and is designed to:

- **Consolidate:** Reduce cost and complexity by safely consolidating
  mission-critical applications onto a single storage platform.

- **Automate:** Increase productivity with deep infrastructure integrations.

- **Scale:** Dynamically scale storage resources to meet business demands.

Each SolidFire storage node utilizes the Element OS software, which includes
the following features:

**Automated Management**

- Automatic distribution and load balancing
- Comprehensive API
- Complete Management Integrations

**Scale-out**

- 10’s of TBs to multiple PBs
- Non-disruptive scaling and no downtime
- Mix nodes in same cluster

**Guaranteed Performance**

- Allocate storage performance independent of capacity
- Manage performance in real-time without impacting other volumes
- Guarantee performance to every volume with fine-grain QoS settings

**Global Efficiency**

- Inline and post compression
- Always-on deduplication
- Global thin provisioning

**Data Assurance**

- Helix RAID-less data protection
- Real-time replication (Asynchronous and Synchronous)
- Integrated backup and recovery (cloud)
