Description of FAS Systems
==========================

The FAS family is a unified storage systems family with integrated data
protection, robust data management, and built-in storage efficiency for
virtualized, shared infrastructure and business applications. FAS
storage is excellent for data management efficiency, virtualized
infrastructure, shared workloads, and IT as a service delivery. FAS
systems are often referred to as “filers.” FAS systems can be configured
with a variety of media types including hybrid (Flash, SSD, SAS, and
SATA) as well as all flash configurations.

Detailed information on the individual options within the FAS family is
available at: http://www.netapp.com/us/products/storage-systems/.

    **Note**

    NetApp’s OpenStack Block Storage drivers interact directly with Data
    ONTAP and are abstract to the specific FAS platform. Any given
    hardware platform supported by a version of Data ONTAP that in turn
    is supported by a particular OpenStack Block Storage driver. Refer
    to `??? <#cinder.fas.configuration>`__ for more information on
    prerequisites for Data ONTAP.
