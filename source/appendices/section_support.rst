Support
=======

NetApp privides support for OpenStack connections with NetApp backends via 
the standard NetApp support channels of either calling 888.4.NETAPP (US and 
Canada) (888.463.8277), 00.800.44.638277 (EMEA/Europe), +800.800.80.800 
(Asia/Pacific), or going to https://mysupport.netapp.com and submitting a
support request. 

Community support is available through the 'thePub' slack channel:
http://netapp.io/slack.

All documentation for NetApp's drivers for OpenStack are contained in this 
Deployment Operations Guide.  A link to the most current version can always
be found at http://netapp.io/openstack/.

NetApp’s Interoperability Matrix (IMT) details components and versions
of qualified configurations. Since the majority of OpenStack provides a
control plane it’s not presently explicitly called out, but host
operating system, hypervisor, and other components involved in the data
path should be noted.

The NetApp OpenStack team presently intends to provide maintenance of
the two most recently released versions of OpenStack. For example,
during Rocky development, all code that is part of the Queens and
Pike official branches are supported. Upon Rocky release, direct
maintenance for Pike would be dropped and maintenance for Rocky is
added.

NetApp can provide customized support options for production
requirements. For more information, please contact your sales team.
