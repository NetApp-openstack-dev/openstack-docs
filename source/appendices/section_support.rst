Support
=======

NetApp provides support for OpenStack connections with NetApp backends via 
the standard NetApp support channels by either calling 888.4.NETAPP (US and 
Canada) (888.463.8277), 00.800.44.638277 (EMEA/Europe), +800.800.80.800 
(Asia/Pacific), or going to https://mysupport.netapp.com and submitting a
support request. 

Community support is available through the 'thePub' slack channel:
http://netapp.io/slack.

All documentation for NetApp's drivers for OpenStack are contained in this 
Deployment Operations Guide.  A link to the most current version can always
be found at http://netapp.io/openstack/.

If your host operating system, hypervisor, and other components involved
in the data path are approved through the IMT, then as long as you are 
using an OpenStack release (or n-1) version, your configuration is supported.
See https://mysupport.netapp.com/matrix to verify your configuration is 
supported.

The NetApp OpenStack team presently intends to provide maintenance of
the two most recently released versions of OpenStack. For example,
during Rocky development, all code that is part of the Queens and
Pike official branches are supported. Upon Rocky release, direct
maintenance for Pike would be dropped and maintenance for Rocky is
added.

NetApp can provide customized support options for production
requirements. For more information, please contact your sales team.
