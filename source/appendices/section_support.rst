Support
=======

Community support is available through the NetApp Communities site:
http://communities.netapp.com/groups/openstack.

NetApp’s Interoperability Matrix (IMT) details components and versions
of qualified configurations. Since the majority of OpenStack provides a
control plane it’s not presently explicitly called out, but host
operating system, hypervisor, and other components involved in the data
path should be noted.

The NetApp OpenStack team presently intends to provide maintenance of
the two most recently released versions of OpenStack. For example,
during Juno development, all code that is part of the Havana and
Icehouse official branches are supported. Upon Juno release, direct
maintenance for Havana would be dropped and maintenance for Icehouse is
added.

NetApp can provide customized support options for production
requirements. For more information, please contact your sales team.
