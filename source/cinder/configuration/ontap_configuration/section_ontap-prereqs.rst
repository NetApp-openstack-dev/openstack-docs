ONTAP Configuration
===================

The prerequisites for ONTAP (both ONTAP and
ONTAP operating in 7-Mode) are:

-  The driver requires a storage controller running ONTAP 8.1.1 or
   later.

-  The storage system should have the following licenses applied:

   -  Base

   -  NFS (if the NFS storage protocol is to be used)

   -  iSCSI (if the iSCSI storage protocol is to be used)

   -  FCP (if the Fibre Channel protocol is to be used)

   -  FlexClone

   -  MultiStore (if vFiler units are used with ONTAP operating in
      7-Mode)
