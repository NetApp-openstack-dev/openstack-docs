Deployment Choices: SolidFire and ONTAP
=======================================

**SolidFire**

Guaranteeing performance, high availability, and unsurpassed scale,
SolidFire is the industry's most comprehensive OpenStack block
storage integration. SolidFire benefits include Quality of Service
(QoS), which guarantees performance to every cloud application, and
Helix data protection, which ensures that data is available and
protected against loss and corruption. SolidFire also allows the
incremental and non-disruptive addition of nodes and has a full-featured
API that enables complete automation. Fully compatible with object storage
for integrated backup and restore, SolidFire has unsurpassed knowledge
of the Cinder block storage services within OpenStack.

**ONTAP**


If rich data management, deep data protection, and storage efficiency
are desired and should be availed directly by the storage, the NetApp
FAS and the All Flash FAS (AFF) product line is a natural fit for use
within Cinder deployments. Massive scalability, nondisruptive operations,
proven storage efficiencies, and a unified architecture (NAS and SAN)
are key features offered by the ONTAP storage operating system. These
capabilities are frequently leveraged in existing virtualization deployments
and thus align naturally to OpenStack use cases.
