Theory of Operation: NetApp Unified Driver Overview
==================================================================

NetApp drivers for ONTAP and E-Series
are offered in a single, unified driver for the purpose of
provisioning and maintaining OpenStack block storage volumes.

Where to Obtain the Drivers
---------------------------

NetAppâ€™s contribution strategy involves adding all new capabilities
directly into the upstream OpenStack Block Storage repositories, so all
the features are available regardless of which distribution you choose
when deploying OpenStack. Bug fixes are delivered into the appropriate
branches that represent the different releases of OpenStack.

On occasion, it may be necessary for NetApp to deliver capability to a
previous release of OpenStack that can not be accepted in the upstream
OpenStack repositories. In that case, we post the capability at the
NetApp Github repository - accessible at
https://github.com/NetApp/cinder. Be sure to choose the branch from this
repository that matches the release version of OpenStack you are
deploying with.

Multiple Deployment Options
---------------------------

The following lists all of the individual options and subsequent
sections are intended to offer guidance on which configuration options
ought to be employed given varying use cases:

-  :ref:`NetApp ONTAP with
   iSCSI <cdot-iscsi>`

-  :ref:`NetApp ONTAP with
   NFS <cdot-nfs>`

-  :ref:`NetApp ONTAP with Fibre
   Channel <cdot-fc>`

-  :ref:`E-Series with iSCSI <eseries-iscsi>`

-  :ref:`E-Series with FCP <eseries-fc>`
