Theory of Operation: NetApp Cinder Drivers Overview
==================================================================

NetApp's Cinder Drivers enable the usage of ONTAP and SolidFire
backends for provisioning and maintaining OpenStack block
storage volumes. NetApp ONTAP drivers for iSCSI, NVMe/TCP, NFS and FC are
offered as a single, unified driver.

Where to Obtain the Drivers
---------------------------

NetAppâ€™s contribution strategy involves adding all new capabilities
directly into the upstream OpenStack Block Storage repositories, so all
the features are available regardless of which distribution you choose
when deploying OpenStack. Bug fixes are delivered into the appropriate
branches that represent the different releases of OpenStack.

On occasion, it may be necessary for NetApp to deliver capability to a
previous release of OpenStack that can not be accepted in the upstream
OpenStack repositories. In that case, we post the capability at the
NetApp Github repository - accessible at
https://github.com/NetApp/cinder. Be sure to choose the branch from this
repository that matches the release version of OpenStack you are
deploying with.

Multiple Deployment Options
